# Dockerised Minecraft Servers

## Just a note
I found these java jar files from random mediafire links and mega download sites. I have launched them to see if they work and if they do, I publish them here. Take that into mind before running them on your shiney servers.

## About Alpha And Beta ...
It seems like the servers have to be ran in offline mode so that you can join. Seems like Mojang doesn't enable those authentication servers anymore?
